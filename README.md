## Version Control

- _Version control_, also known as _source control_, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code so that you can recall a specific version of it later.

## Difference between Git and GitHub

- Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
- GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

## Alternatives to Git

## Git Fetch and Git Pull

- git fetch is used to fetch changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
- git pull is used to fetch changes and automatically merge them into your current working branch.
